#### About

MrMC is a software media center for playing videos, music, and pictures. 
MrMC, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and
remote controls. It allows users to play and view most videos, music,
and other digital media files from local storage media and media
devices/servers such as Emby, Plex, HDHomerun, TVHeadend and more.

While MrMC functions very well as a standard media player application for your
computer, it has been designed to be the perfect companion for your HTPC.
Supporting an almost endless range of remote controls, and combined with its
beautiful interface and powerful skinning engine, MrMC feels very natural to
use from the couch and is the ideal solution for your home theater.

Currently MrMC can be used to play almost all popular audio and video formats
around. It was designed for network playback, so you can stream your multimedia
from anywhere in the house or directly from the internet using practically any
protocol available.

Use your media as-is: MrMC can play decrypted CD's, DVD's and Bluray's directly
from the disk or image file, almost all popular archive formats from your hard
drive, and even files inside ZIP and RAR archives. It will even scan all of
your media and automatically create a personalized library complete with box
covers, descriptions, and fanart. There are playlist and slideshow functions, a
weather forecast feature and many audio visualizations. Once installed, your
computer will become a fully functional multimedia jukebox.
